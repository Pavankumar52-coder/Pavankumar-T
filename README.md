## Gmail Auth Handling:

Gmail blocks headless/automated logins with 2FA, CAPTCHA, and security prompts. To handle this:

- For this i used a real Chrome browser with visible UI (headed).
- Screenshots are taken at every step to simulate live feedback.
- If Gmail blocks login, user is advised to manually log in the browser.
